    prerequisite:
    Iteration/Loops
    Functions
    *Recursion and Iteration vai-vai
    *Tasks that are done by iteration- all tasks can be done using recursion.
    Trees , Graphs algorithms use Recursion 

    *When recursion happens inside memory - all the function calls is saved in stack form....When in memory new stack layer is created, As many parameters inside function - new memory space is created for all parameters - in every function call.

    *If we don't keep base case in recursion- in one point our memory gets full and stack overflow problem occurs.

    *We don't use the same variable like iteration in recursion.
