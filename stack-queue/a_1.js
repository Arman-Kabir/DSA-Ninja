/**
 #1 stack and queues both are called linear data structures.
*Linear data structures allow us to traverse that is go through data elements sequentially one by one in which only one data element can be directly reached. 

#2- Stack - LIFO - Last in first out. 
*Most programming languages are modeled with the stack architecture in mind and when functions get called in a programming language usually they follow this model of last in first out - > a function within a function within a function gets called. And then we start popping those functions until we get to the very beginning.
*Stack is used in browser history. 

#3 - Queue - FIFO- First in first out - 

#4 -
